I'm wondering if we should have a more attainable prototype... Basically a prototype to try and make fun before we actually build the first iteration of the game with proper design in mind

- Overworld-focus
- Zelda tiles, fixed-width grid map with grass-only theme. Procedural generate map
- Explore mechanic but not FoW
- WC2 city + neutral mines / wells
- Battle is still instanced, but no grid movement. Just separate out soldiers in (2) lines and choose target
    * can't choose back line until both front lines in front are dead
    * two back lines three front
    * Battles are either open grass or defend city
- Max 5 units in army
- armies built from cities
- simplified cities -> recruits, 5 dwellings, gold tier x3, buy army, special unit, elixir progression
- gold (village) / ore (mine) / elixir (well), capture these and they produce
- combat:
    * life / damage / armor / resist / speed / range+melee+magic / stack size
- armies have set vision of ~5 tiles
- city building still meaningful
- pick simple set of GUI controls, don't elaborate even if it's inconvenient. Use text entry
