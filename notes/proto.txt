Major design decisions:
Procedural generation format
Tech / unit / buildings content
HUD
Scouting process
Battle background

Overview:
 * 15 - 30 minute instances
 * No Multiplayer (no AI, low RNG)
 * Procedural map generation (low content needs)
 * Economy and city building have meaningful choices
 * Limited resources / shared resources (battle to control resource areas)
 * Build towards high-level creatures is rewarding
 * x1 race to start (x3 for full game)
 * HOMM style armies, but no heroes

Terrain / Map:
 - Trees / rocks / etc. which are non-pathable
  - dirt / grass tiles
 - water / bridge for map control and boundaries
 - Arcane Wells, when captured / established produces Elixir

Resources:
 - mines produce ore
 - arcane wells produce elixir
 - cities and villages produce gold
 - can leave guard armies at mines / villages / cities / arcane wells at no added cost

City Building:
 - build time in days (turns)
 - cities can be attacked, defenders bonus (wall battleground in favor of defender?)
 - no separate scene for cities, they are large graphically and actually contain the buildings you can build
 - buildings unlock unit types, increase recruits, increase gold, elixir resource progression, increase defense, increase sight?
    add army and/or mine bonuses?

Army Assembly:
 - units are always in either an 'army' or a city
 - it is expensive to build an 'army' for transporting units / fighting / exploring / claiming mines
 - no limit on types of unit within an army
 - have recruits of main race trickle in every day, these can be trained into main units
 - Beast / special units have their own 'recruit' population and have to be trained / hired
 - armies can merge / share freely like HOMM
 - no neutral armies (?)

Combat:
 - number of units in stack (HOMM)
 - square-grid based - stats: speed / damage / armor / life
 - three types of attacks: range / melee / magic (bonus triad?)

Overworld Movement:
 - armies can take a day to switch 'modes' between 'caravan' (faster but vulnerable) and 'march' (ready for battle, but slower)
 - fog of war and exploration, AoE2 style
 - attack / move / interact / etc. is done on overworld grid, HOMM style
 - terrain like trees / rocks / mountains is blocking obviously
 - army has set move per turn based on army type

Graphics:
 - WC3 (WC2) for icons (wc3c.net, hiveworkshop.com for custom)
 - Pita or FBB (temp) terrain and map tiles, cities
 - FBB overworld armies (WC2)
 - FBB battle sprites (WC2 / HOMM2)
 - Generic pixel art SFX
 - designating mines / arcane wells / cities should be team color
 - HUD -> found a cool GUI set here: https://www.google.ca/search?q=pixel+fantasy+gui&client=ms-android-samsung&prmd=inv&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi1iYHSmJLfAhXFHDQIHfNkC4oQ_AUoAXoECA4QAQ&biw=360&bih=560#imgrc=O6Qm8FUp-VmwJM:
