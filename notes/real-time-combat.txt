Units:
Life / Armor / Damage / Speed (equivalent to move tiles)

Combat:
* 2 phases, orders and execution

Order Phase:
* each player has 3 orders per turn
* potential actions are Shoot (ranged) / move / defend / attack move

Shoot:
- Select unit to shoot at, blocked by units in front (blocking algorithm??)
- Fires once turn is reached, at that point blocking is calculated

Move:
- Select tile within range to move to
- Can walk through allies
- Cannot walk through enemies
- If blocked by enemy
    * if destination is still within range, take alternate route
    * if destination is not in range, pathfind as close as possible
    * if all movement is blocked, take no action (LOST ACTION!)

Defend:
- Gain defender's bonus for duration of next engagement -50% damage, +25% damage
- No movement obviously
- Defend's are non-action's, meaning the bonus is given immediately upon defend order. In actual turn order just the animation plays

Attack-Move:
- Attack move toward a target tile (tile may be occupied)
- allies don't block
- find direct route (ignoring occupied cells) to 'attack tile':
    * if target ends on ally, search for surrounding + reachable cells. If none available. Back-track on route and repeat
        # If allies block entire path and no suitable replacements are found, consider current tile the 'attack tile'
    * if target ends on enemy, search for surrounding + reachable tiles to engage from
        # if no tiles are found, backtrack on route for suitable 'attack tile'
    * starting from current cell -> if target path is blocked by enemy, search for suitable cell to engage enemy from   
        # if none is found -> ??
    * If direct path is blocked by enemy but we COULD reach the target tile, which takes priority? Farther enemy?
    * If the target tile is unreachable, do we do a breadth first search to find an attackable enemy?
    * What if path to target is blocked by enemy, but there's no suitable cell to engage from? do nothing?
    * What if target cell is free, but not adjacent to enemies, but we pass enemies on the way to target cell?
    * What logic if there is no valid path to target? Find direct and check for enemies?
    * Should the target cell be considered directional or specific?
        # directional might be simpler to implement, but will feel quite random for the player. Might as well just have generic
            'move forward' button
        # specific will have a ton of different cases to work through, but might make player feel more in control

Engagements:
- At the start of each 'execution phase', all units who are currently in an engagement will deal their damage
- If a unit in an engage receives a move command, they will be 'vulnerable' for the rest of that turn (+50% damage?)
- All above considerations for 'attack-move' could be applied differently for a unit who was previously engaged:
    * for example, if you disengage but try to attack-move, but then the move is unavailable, what happens?
    * What the path is unavailable but an adjacent enemy is blocking the path? Just switch targets? confusing because the   
            unit it was previously engaged too should still attack, but logic says the other unit broke the engagement...
    * directional could still maybe work here except the previously engaged unit is not an option for the target acquisition algorithm
    * a specific-target system might make for some weird results if the pathway is blocked, or the target cell is unavailable due to allies
